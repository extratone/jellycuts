This shortcut helps communicate stress and energy levels to others.

ðŸŸ¢ = Minimal stress levels, can take in new information.
ðŸŸ¡ = Heightened stress levels, but can manage current task.
ðŸ”´ = Overwhelmed, might not be able to comprehend new information.

ðŸ¥„ = Refers to Spoon Theory, a way to explain how much energy (or how many spoons) you have to do tasks, chores or activityâ€™s for that day. â€¨
Imagine every action you do costs a spoon; making breakfast, getting dressed, seeing a friend, travel etc.
