/*
// Description

The shortcut helps you follow a channel in the Play app by allowing you to send a YouTube channelâ€™s URL, or list of URLs, to it.

But its best use is to copy all your YouTube subscriptions over at once. Just selext the whole list of your channel subs in YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels), copy the text, and then run this shortcut. It will extract the channel URLs and follow them one-by-one in Play.
