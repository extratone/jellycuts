This shortcut is literally just a duplicate of Michael Bierman’s “Clean Apple News Links” shortcut: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4234/

I’ve just removed everything after the URL is returned and instead added the “Open URLs” action. 

It works!

I’m @NeoYokel on Twitter and/or reachable at davidblue@extratone.com if you need help or would like to point out something I could improve.

Version 1.1 

To be honest, I had to duplicate Bierman’s shortcut again, though I believe I understood better what the shortcut was doing. All I know is that 1.0 was only returning the parent directory of a given cleaned Apple News link, but this one should return the right one without any remaining unnecessary stuff. :)
